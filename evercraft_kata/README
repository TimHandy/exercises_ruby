This is the recommended way to set up a skeleton template file structure for new projects.


Using the Skeleton
Whenever you want to start a new project, just do this:

Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
Rename (move) the lib/NAME.rb file and lib/NAME/ directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.
Edit your Gemspec to have all the information for your project.
Rename tests/test_NAME.rb to also have your module name.
Double check it's all working by using ruby tests/test_yourproject.rb again. You can also use 'rake test' to run the the test.
Start coding.


Here's me doing it:

$ cp -r skeleton ex47
$ cd ex47
$ ls
NAME.gemspec   bin             doc             lib
Rakefile       data            ext             tests
$ mv NAME.gemspec ex47.gemspec
$ mv bin/NAME bin/ex47
$ mv tests/test_NAME.rb tests/test_ex47.rb
$ mv lib/NAME lib/ex47
$ mv lib/NAME.rb lib/ex47.rb
$ find . -name "*NAME*" -print
$
