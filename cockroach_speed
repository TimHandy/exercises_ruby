Cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns the number of whole (floored) cm it moves per second.

Example: 
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.


describe "Basic Tests" do
  Test.assert_equals(cockroach_speed(1.08),30)
  Test.assert_equals(cockroach_speed(1.09),30)
  Test.assert_equals(cockroach_speed(0),0)
end





def cockroach_speed(s)

end




















ANSWER :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::







def cockroach_speed(s)
  kms = s / 60 / 60
  cms = kms * 1000 * 100
  cms.to_i
end
