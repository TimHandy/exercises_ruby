What if Grandma doesnâ€™t want you to leave?
When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you.
Change your previous program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row.
Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times but not in a row, you should still be talking to Grandma.
